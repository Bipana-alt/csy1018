	     <div class="site">Hello again,Frankly speaking it was kind of tough for me at the beggining,i had no idea regarding this field but now i am doing pretty good then i had expected.I actually was struggling with coding but then i did some self study and took help from teachers and i am finally able to do some codings.I watched youtube videos for learning even more.Now,i am doing pretty good and i'm able to make website.<br><br></div>

         <div class="site">This module was supposed to be the tough module in comparison to other but it wasn't that tough after i researched and did some self study.I found this module quite hard at the beggining but now it find this module very intresting.<br><br></div>

         <div class="site">At first,the made the home page of my portfolio.it really wasn't that big deal to prepare the home page.in home page i prepared the menu as mentioned in th assignment in all the pages.for preparing the home page i mentioned a short introduction with menu on the top.I used background image from google for the better look.in css of home page i used shadow syntax for the introduction part and tansferred menu to the right side.<br>
         secondly,i prepared the portfolio page where i kept some placeholder images as haven't done anything right now.I used fielset for thr better look.some dummy images are placed which will be replaced later on during second assignment.<br><br>
         on third page i prepared the contact form where complete information can be filled and at last it can be submitted.information like name,address,email etc were on the contact page.i used the hover and the fieldset property there.<br><br>
         we were supposed to prepare the cv on the fouth page and i kept the picture of myself there at the left side and i wrote about myself there regarding my hobbies,education and so on.i uesd fieldset property there as well and grid to manage the position.<br><br></div>
