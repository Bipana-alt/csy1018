	    <div class="site">Hello again,Frankly speaking it was kind of tough for me at the beggining,I couldn't understand stuff. I felt like quitting.The load was something my mind couldn't bear but overthing all these could only lead to downfall and downfall is something that i can not afford.My hardwork and dedication has always been my greatest strength.Even when i'm exhausted,i tried to push a little further every other time.but now I am doing pretty good then i had expected.I actually was struggling with coding but then I did some self study and took help from teachers and i am finally able to do some codings.I watched youtube videos for learning even more and to make the proper use of tags.I tried really hard and finally,I am capable enough to create a website and  i'm so thankful for that towards my module teacher for helping me.<br><br></div>
       
        <div class="site">This module was supposed to be the tough module in comparison to other but it wasn't that tough after i researched and did some self study.I found this module quite hard at the beggining but now I find this module quite intresting.I learned to use the appropriate html elements.I was stuggling in making page responsive but I managed to build it as well.I tried everything which was mentioned in our slides provided by our module teacher which helped me a lot in doing this assignment.I learnt to make hamburger menu icon in responsive view which was quite hard at the beggining but somehow I managed to create hamburger menu icon as well.<br><br></div>

        <div class="exp">About Pages</div><br> 
        <div class="site">At first,the made the home page of my portfolio.it really wasn't that big deal to prepare the home page.in home page I prepared the menu,as mentioned in th assignment in all the pages.for preparing the home page I mentioned a short introduction with menu on the top.I used background image from google for the better look.in css of home page i used shadow syntax for the introduction part and tansferred menu to the right side.I kept one tagline there saying,"winners don't do diffrent things,they do things differently.",with some transition.<br><br>

        secondly,I prepared the portfolio page where I kept some placeholder images as haven't done anything right now.I used fielset for thr better look.some dummy images are placed which will be replaced later on during second assignment.<br><br>
